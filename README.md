# Objective

In this project, I will create an interactive dashboard of coffee sales that can be filtered by year, quantity sold, roast type, and by members of the loyalty program. This can allow me to analyze the customer sales dataset and understand the frequency of purchases by customer and country. Note that this project was completed in Google Sheets and you may encounter issues with compiling it if you use Excel directly.

# Data

The provided Excel worksheet includes three datasets: orders, customers, and products. The orders dataset includes the raw sales of coffee, including the customer ID, the order date, customer emails, and so on. The customers dataset includes details of each customer, such as their name, address, loyalty card information, and so on. The products dataset includes details of the coffee sold, such as the name of the roast, the quantity produced, the selling price, and so on.
